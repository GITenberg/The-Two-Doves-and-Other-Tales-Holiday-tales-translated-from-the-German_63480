<h2><a name="THE_TWO_DOVES" id="THE_TWO_DOVES"></a>THE TWO DOVES.</h2>
</div>

<p>I will now tell you a story about two good little children, Marian
and Henry, who lived some time ago in Switzerland.</p>

<p>Marian was seven years old, and her little brother Henry was about
five. They were the hope and delight of their Mamma, who loved them
with the most tender affection. These good children had always lived
together,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
and so much pleasure did they take in each other's society,
that being together seemed their greatest happiness. Marian could
not be happy an instant away from her brother; Henry was never more
pleased than when with his sister. Whether walking in the fields, or
at play in their little room, at meal times or at study, they always
acted together; and this was partly the reason why they agreed so well.
You would see Marian's large doll beside Henry's little soldier, and
Henry's wooden horse close by the doll's cradle. On the same chair
would be lying together the doll's cap and the soldier's hat, a tiny
parasol, and a little sword. So we may be quite sure that whatever
belonged to one was used to amuse the other, and that the hearts of
Marian and Henry lived in unison.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
One day a friend of their Mamma sent them a present of a pair of
Doves, beautifully white, except that their necks were encircled with a
black ring. Henry and Marian could not make enough of these Doves. They
were so tame that they would perch on the children's heads, or their
shoulders, or their arms; they would peck food from their hands, and
sometimes even take it from their mouth. "Ah, you pretty bird," said
Marian, "nothing has ever pleased me so much."</p>

<p>"They are always together as we are, they love one another so much,"
said Henry.</p>

<p>"We will do as they do, Henry, we will always be together."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span> "Always, dear sister," and the
children embraced each other, while the Doves fluttered upon their
shoulders, seeming to feel as happy as the children were.</p>

<p>The birds were taken great care of in their little house, and became
more and more beautiful, their feathers were white as snow, and they
strutted up and down, seeming to be quite proud of their habitation;
they enjoyed their liberty very often, for Marian and Henry would open
the door of their little house, and they would come out to be petted
by the children, and would seem thankful for the good fortune that had
placed them in such good hands. But their love to these birds gave rise
to a little jealousy<span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span> between Henry
and Marian; they would talk about whose turn it was to open the door,
and then about the right to feed them, or give them fresh water. Marian
would say, laughingly, that they loved her brother more than herself;
Henry would contradict that, and say that he was sure they liked his
sister better. This little jealous feeling (as is often the case with
much older people) turned out to be the cause of much unhappiness to
these little ones. They became desirous that each Dove should have a
separate house for itself. They made this wish known to their good
Mamma, who, without opposing or approving their scheme,

had two cages placed in Marian's room, and one day <span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>
she went with her brother to decide which bird each should have; so
they agreed that the door should be set open in the usual way, and that
the bird which perched first on Marian's head or arm should belong to
her, and the other to Henry. This was soon done, and Marian's Dove
was shut up in one cage and Henry's Dove in the other. The poor birds
soon became sad and still, their beautiful white feathers turned to
a dull yellow, they ceased to flap their wings, and their cooing was
no more heard. The best of wheat and beans, and the clearest water,
were given to them in abundance, but all were of no use; the Doves
could not endure being separate from each other. Each would sit
<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span> on the highest perch in its house,
and long for the company of the other; or sometimes they would weary
themselves with trying to get through the bars, and when quite tired
out, each would return to its solitary perch. Henry and Marian were
very much afflicted at all this, and told their distress to their dear
mother, who, under the pretence that they might give more attention to
the birds, proposed that each should have one in a separate room, and
remain alone with it. The first day seemed rather long to the children,
but those who watched over them, and delighted in seeing them together,
were desirous of giving them experience, and so they remained a second
day; now this day was to both more <span class="pagenum">[Pg10]</span>
dreary than the first, and on the third day they found it quite
unbearable.</p>

<p>"No play," said Henry; "Oh, this is very wearisome; I would give all
my playthings to be a little while with my sister."</p>

<p>"How can I," said Marian, "live without my brother? Without him
there is no play; I can not be happy away from him. Without him I care
for nothing; every thing is tedious; I can not bear it any longer."</p>

<p>The truth is, they could not be happy away from each other, so they
entreated their Mamma to allow them to be together again, as it was
impossible for them to live separately.</p>

<p>"So it is," said their mother, "with your young Doves.<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
They came from the same nest, they have been nourished and fed
together, they are accustomed to live with one another, and they feel
it, as you yourselves do, a painful thing to be parted, and will soon
die of grief."</p>

<p>At these words both the children started, and ran and released the
prisoners. Out flew the doves, rejoicing in their liberty, and caressed
each other with their beaks. They seemed by their cooing to thank those
who had released them. They soon became as healthy as before, and their
feathers also became as white as ever. Marian and Henry resolved never
to separate them again, but to attend them as they did at first; and
the two cages were taken away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span> "My dear children," said their good
mother to them, pressing them to her bosom; "you have now learned
that the ties of relationship bind faster than chains; they give the
greatest joy to our hearts, they are our greatest happiness; may you
long love one another and be happy; forget not, that in the palace or
in the humble cottage, in the busy world, or the more retired life, the
tongue speaks nothing more pleasing, and the ear hears nothing more
sweet, than the endearing names&mdash;Brother and Sister; even with
the oldest people, it gives joy to remember when they lisped those
words."</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="THE_ANT-HOUSES" id="THE_ANT-HOUSES"></a>THE ANT-HOUSES.</h2>
</div>

<p>Robert gave his cousin Richard, for a birth-day present, a
nightingale, in a beautiful green cage, and told him to feed it with
meal-worms and ants' eggs. The miller or the baker would supply him
with the meal-worms, but the ants' eggs he would be pretty sure to find
in his father's garden. He would only have to put a flower-pot, or a
little wooden tub, in some dry sunny place, and the ants would find
their way under the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
hedge, and lay their eggs there; for they are always careful to put
them where the rain can not come.</p>

<p>Richard bought some meal-worms, but
they cost almost all his pocket-money; and he must set about finding
the ants' eggs, which would cost him nothing. So he did as Robert had
told him, and, to his great delight, he found when he took up the
flower-pot, on the next day, that a whole colony of ants had crept
under it; for the earth was thrown up into little heaps, and looked
fine, as if it had been sifted. Some little ants were trotting about
quickly, as if they were trying to find out what had happened to make
it so suddenly light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
Richard took a stick, and stirred the earth a little, and found a
great many little, long white eggs lying about. He stretched out his
hand to put the eggs into a little cup which he had brought with him,
when, to his great amazement, the little ants caught up the eggs in
their mouths, and ran away with them.</p>

<p>When Richard saw the kind motherly care of the ants, the tears came
into his eyes, and he said, "No, I can not be so cruel as to trouble
all these little creatures just to make one happy; and my little
nightingale would like much better to sing in the cool green trees
than in his close prison of a cage. I will go and let him fly where he
pleases."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>He did so, and oh! how soon the nightingale
darted off to the grove near by, where
his song was heard for many a long summer's
evening after; and how joyful, too,
Richard's heart felt.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
